# Error Handling Test

This test verifies that:

1. **Missing file links are preserved**: Links to non-existent files like `[missing file](missing.md)` remain as external links and are not converted to section links.

2. **Existing file links are processed**: Links to existing files like `[existing file](existing.md)` are converted to section links and the files are included.

3. **No errors are thrown**: The tool handles missing files gracefully without crashing.

The key insight is that missing files are never added to the traversal queue during the link discovery phase, so they never reach the file processing phase where errors might occur.
